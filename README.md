# TinyTorch

TinyTorch is a personal fork of the [MiniTorch](https://github.com/minitorch/minitorch) teaching library ‚Äî a DIY deep learning framework built from scratch to teach the internals of machine learning systems.

This project is where I implement **all of the assignments**, step by step, to gain a deep understanding of:

- Core ML programming concepts
- Automatic differentiation
- Tensor operations
- GPU and parallel execution
- Foundational deep learning components

By the end, TinyTorch will be able to run real Torch-like code in pure Python.

## üìö Assignments & Goals

The project is organized as a series of progressive assignments. Each one builds on the previous to implement a working, minimalist deep learning framework:

1. **ML Programming Foundations**

   - Scalars, arithmetic operations
   - Computation graph construction
   - Writing forward/backward passes manually

2. **Autodifferentiation**

   - Implementing backpropagation
   - Designing `ScalarFunction` classes like `Mul`, `Add`, `ReLU`, etc.
   - Building a flexible autograd system

3. **Tensors**

   - Extending scalars to multi-dimensional arrays
   - Broadcasting, indexing, and efficient storage

4. **GPUs & Parallel Programming**

   - Writing CUDA kernels
   - Running operations on GPUs for speedup

5. **Foundational Deep Learning**

   - Linear layers, loss functions, optimizers
   - Training a small neural network end-to-end

Example task inside the repo:

```python
class ReLU(ScalarFunction):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, a):
        # TODO: Implement for Task 1.2
        raise NotImplementedError("Need to implement for Task 1.2")

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, d_output):
        # TODO: Implement for Task 1.4
        raise NotImplementedError("Need to implement for Task 1.4")
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

TinyTorch requires **Python 3.11+**.

### 1. Check Your Python Version

```bash
python --version
python3 --version
```

### 2. Create a Workspace

We recommend a single workspace folder for all assignments:

```bash
mkdir workspace && cd workspace
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

This keeps dependencies isolated:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You only need to run the first line once.
Run the second line whenever you open a new terminal.
Your prompt should show `(venv)` if activation worked.

See the [venv docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for more info.

### 4. Clone & Install

Clone your forked TinyTorch repo and install requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tinytorch.git
cd tinytorch
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements.extra.txt
python -m pip install -Ue .
```

For Anaconda users, you may also need:

```bash
conda install llvmlite
```

### 5. Verify Installation

Run Python and check that the library imports:

```python
import minitorch
```

If no error appears, you are ready to start implementing!

## üß† Philosophy

TinyTorch is designed to be:

- **Readable:** Every line is easy to understand, even for newcomers.
- **Incremental:** Each assignment builds upon the last.
- **Educational:** The goal is mastery, not speed.

## üéØ Goals for This Fork

‚úÖ Re-implement every MiniTorch assignment
‚úÖ Write clear docstrings and comments for each function
‚úÖ Add small tests and experiments to confirm correctness
‚úÖ Explore optional extensions like new activations or optimizers

## üôå Credits

- Original project: [MiniTorch](https://github.com/minitorch/minitorch)
- Developed for _Machine Learning Engineering_ at Cornell Tech by [David Duvenaud](https://cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) and collaborators.
- Inspired by industry experience at Hugging Face.

Would you like me to add a **section for visualizations** (e.g., showing loss curves, computation graphs) since MiniTorch includes tools for tracking your progress?

**Q1:** Should I include a section with sample `pytest` commands for running the included unit tests?
**Q2:** Do you want me to add a short ‚ÄúContributing‚Äù section in case others want to learn from your fork?
**Q3:** Would you like me to include a roadmap checklist that you can update as you finish each assignment?
